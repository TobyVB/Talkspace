Greetings

- This is an ongoing project I am working on. It is a social media site inspired by Reddit, Facebook, and Myspace.
- Features I plan to add.
  - Load up to ~ 10-20 posts on any given page, then load in more as user scrolls
  - Improved security
  - Instant messaging chat
  - Reddit style nested comments
  - User can can add another userâ€™s or their own post to folders they create
  - User can be friends with another user
  - User can choose which folder to be their default profile.
